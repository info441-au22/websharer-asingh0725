The additional piece of information I previewed is the og:type from the
open graph piece of information.
A url that has a piece of information: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3281548/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0.
A style that I added was I added an underline to the additonal piece of information I previewed(og:type). I
added it because I want to emphasize the content type in the preview of the website.
